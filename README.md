# Solar-Power-Prediction

 ☀️ Solar Irradiance Prediction using XGBoost

A machine learning project for predicting Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) using the XGBoost algorithm. This tool aims to enhance solar energy forecasting, critical for renewable energy systems, smart grid management, and energy market operations.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) is affected by unpredictable weather, seasonal changes, and day-night cycles, making it challenging to model using traditional methods. This project leverages XGBoost to provide accurate, data-driven predictions.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction from meteorological data
- GHI prediction using the XGBoost algorithm
- Model evaluation with relevant performance metrics
- Scalable and adaptable notebook format (Jupyter)
